Experiments for LIBRAS ISLR task using MINDS, MALTA-LIBRAS, WLASL and SLOVO datasets.

- 'requirements.txt' contains the necessary requirements to run our codes.
- 'seeds.txt' contains the set of seeds used for all our experiments, unless specified otherwise (for single-seed experiments we used seed 42).
- 'lightning_logs' folder contains the .ckpt files, validation and testing .csv results generated by 'create_results.py'.
- 'dataset_intersections' folder contains useful .csv's, including the .csv with MALTA-LIBRAS and MINDS intersection (in utils you may find the original dataset collected from diverse open sources, with 21k LIBRAS videos, which underwent the intense and laborous task of annotating).
- 'paper_experiments' contains our bash scripts for numerous experiments.
- the 'metrics_evaluation' notebook is used to exhibit the results achieved so far by analyzing the .csv's from each experiment run.
- 'build_tensor_dataset.py' was used to generate the tensor files for the MINDS, WLASL and SLOVO datasets.
- 'build_test_dataset_tensors.py' was used to generate tensor files for our MALTA-LIBRAS dataset.
