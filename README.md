# Data downloading instructions

Due to data policies we are unable to provide direct links to download the videos for our dataset, even though all videos are publicly available.

Sources for each dictionary within MALTA-LIBRAS to webscrape videos from:

* INES V2: http://www.acessibilidadebrasil.org.br/libras/ (no longer available, mas achei o .zip q ta num google drive do Nathan, ja baixei e ta na MOTOX, podemos disponibilizar junto com o do Youtube)
* Corpus Libras: https://corpuslibras.ufsc.br/ (on our annotations file, Corpus Libras is referred to as UFSC)
* UFV: https://sistemas.cead.ufv.br/capes/dicionario/ (não consegui fazer webscrape dele, ashley n fez codigo pra essa fonte, mas mesma situação do YouTube e INES V2, o .zip existe e podemos disponibilizar no drive)
* V-LIBRASIL: https://libras.cin.ufpe.br/ (on our annotations file V-LIBRAS is referred to as UFPE)
* For YouTube videos, we provide a direct link to download from:
https://brpucrs-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/10087904_pucrs_br/EUFBuEiJ67BFqtFJm5kTPAYBXuaJma8QXgrPwora6s0S-g?e=7kmnzm


To download the remaining videos for the dictionaries INES V3 (Acessibilidades 3), UFSC (SignBank), Spread the Sign and USP, one can use the script provided in the 'videos_download' folder named 'download_videos.py'. The script, along with each source's .csv, downloads videos directly from the sources:

* INES V3: http://www.acessibilidadebrasil.org.br/libras_3/
* SignBank: https://signbank.libras.ufsc.br/pt (on our annotattions, SignBank is referred as UFSC_V2)
* Spread the Sign: https://www.spreadthesign.com/pt.br/search/
* USP: https://edisciplinas.usp.br/mod/glossary/view.php?id=197645

The annotations for the MALTA-LIBRAS full dataset is the 'glossary.csv' file under "dataset_intersections" folder.

The annotations for the subset of MALTA-LIBRAS used in our experiments is the 'matched_labels_with_tensors.csv' file.

## Files and their descriptions:

- 'requirements.txt' contains the necessary requirements to run our codes.
- 'seeds.txt' contains the set of seeds used for all our experiments, unless specified otherwise (for single-seed experiments we used seed 42).
- the 'metrics_evaluation' notebook is used to exhibit the results achieved so far by analyzing the .csv's from each experiment run.
- 'build_tensor_dataset.py' was used to generate the tensor files for the MINDS, WLASL and SLOVO datasets.
- 'build_test_dataset_tensors.py' was used to generate tensor files for our MALTA-LIBRAS dataset.
- 'lightning_logs' folder contains the .ckpt files, validation and testing .csv results generated by 'create_results.py'.
- 'dataset_intersections' folder contains useful .csv's, including the .csv with MALTA-LIBRAS and MINDS intersection (in utils you may find the original dataset collected from diverse open sources, with 21k LIBRAS videos).
- 'paper_experiments' contains our bash scripts for numerous experiments.
- 'videos_downloads' folder have the scripts to download videos from each source.
