All data from MALTA-LIBRAS dataset was webscraped using XXX (beautiful soup?)

Dictionaries within MALTA-LIBRAS to webscrape videos from:
* INES V2: http://www.acessibilidadebrasil.org.br/libras/ (no longer available)
* Corpus Libras: https://corpuslibras.ufsc.br/ (on our annotations file, Corpus Libras is referred to as UFSC)
* UFV: https://sistemas.cead.ufv.br/capes/dicionario/
* Youtube: path pro zip pra mandar pro Lucas: /mnt/E-SSD/mussi/LIBRAS_datasets/LIBRAS_videos/data/datasets/youtube.zip
* V-LIBRASIL: https://libras.cin.ufpe.br/ (on our annotations file V-LIBRAS is referred to as UFPE)

To download the remaining videos for the dictionaries INES V3 (Acessibilidades 3), UFSC (SignBank), Spread the Sign and USP, one can use scripts and .csv's from this repository:

The annotations for the MALTA-LIBRAS full dataset is the 'glossary.csv' file under "dataset_intersections" folder.

The annotations for the subset of MALTA-LIBRAS used in our experiments is the 'matched_labels_with_tensors.csv' file.

Files and their descriptions:

- 'requirements.txt' contains the necessary requirements to run our codes.
- 'seeds.txt' contains the set of seeds used for all our experiments, unless specified otherwise (for single-seed experiments we used seed 42).
- 'lightning_logs' folder contains the .ckpt files, validation and testing .csv results generated by 'create_results.py'.
- 'dataset_intersections' folder contains useful .csv's, including the .csv with MALTA-LIBRAS and MINDS intersection (in utils you may find the original dataset collected from diverse open sources, with 21k LIBRAS videos).
- 'paper_experiments' contains our bash scripts for numerous experiments.
- the 'metrics_evaluation' notebook is used to exhibit the results achieved so far by analyzing the .csv's from each experiment run.
- 'build_tensor_dataset.py' was used to generate the tensor files for the MINDS, WLASL and SLOVO datasets.
- 'build_test_dataset_tensors.py' was used to generate tensor files for our MALTA-LIBRAS dataset.
